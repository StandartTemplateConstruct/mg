As todayâ€™s information explosion generates greater and greater volumes of raw data, the challenge of storing and retrieving this information in the most efficient manner continues to grow, whether the data is stored on a local disk or distributed over the World-Wide Web.

Managing Gigabytes helps you to meet this challenge by showing how to capitalize on new methods of compressing and accessing data, enabling you to store information more efficiently and locate specific items more quickly and cost-effectively than ever before. It uniquely covers fully-tested techniques for both text and image compression and shows how to construct a tailor-made electronic index for accessing text, scanned documents, and images.

This book largely avoids extensive theoretical and mathematical discussions, making it accessible to curious laypersons who seek a clear, uncomplicated understanding of this new technology. Real, large-scale problems are illustrated, and the technical material is sprinkled with anecdotes and background information. The new edition is updated with information about recent standards and discoveries. An instructor's supplement will be available.

Managing Gigabytes provides current and comprehensive tools and techniques that will help professionals and academics to work more confidently and effectively in today's increasingly paperless society.
